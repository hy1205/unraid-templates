This repository contains templates for Unraid.

A request has been made to get this repository into Community Applications, but the force of censorship was too strong. So sadly, you'll have to do it manually.

Copy the url `https://github.com/hotio/unraid-templates` into the field `Template repositories` on the `DOCKER` tab and hit `SAVE`.
